# Great Trivia INPT

The Great Trivia mobile application is an offline app created using the SQLite Database in Android.

How the app works :
Great trivia INPT is a quiz app containing 5 categories: science, sports, history, geography, computer science and entertainment. The player gets to choose which of the 5 categories to play and then the questions are generated randomly. No question gets repeated more than once. The player gets three chances at the game and a 30 seconds interval to answer each question.  If they choose the correct answer, the answer box is changed to a green color and then proceeds to the following question. If the player gets a wrong answer, the answer box turns red, shows what the correct answer is and then the player loses a chance. Once the player gets three wrong answers, the game is over and they get redirected to the score tab.
